Changing Codes in CaptHist

Codes are defined in 
CbrPit.h       for name
CbrPit.cpp     for output code
Detector.cpp   for input code to name
Obsequence.cpp for use and precedence

output code sequence can be truncated by
truncateAtRecap()
applyMaskSimple()
applyMask()
buildRangeRecord() - also changes last field, if detected, to "1"

Detector codes are set in config_file.txt

TransSampSwitch
There is a section of code that converts Sampled to Transported if it is a transport site (there's a switch for that), and Transported to Unknown if the site is not a transport site. It checks the Transported code every time.
CapthistRun.cpp
    if (outcome == CbrPit::Sampled && settings.isChecked(PitProSettings::SampTransSwitch)
	    && settings.isSet(PitProSettings::TransSite, obsSite)) {
	outcome = CbrPit::Transported;
    } else if (outcome == CbrPit::Transported && !settings.isSet(PitProSettings::TransSite, obsSite))
	outcome = CbrPit::Unknown;

Precedence (email from Steven.G.Smith 8/17/2020)

* If a fish has a "P" at any site (gr/GRS and bv/BCC are currently the only ones where P is used), then it is not expected to have any detections that generate any other code.  Therefore, precedence is not necessary.
(There were, I think, three PIT codes that were supposedly detected at both GRJ and GRS in 2020; we might have to revisit this to figure out what to do in these rare cases).

* The outcomes A, W, D, G, and M apply only to the site tw.  I am tempted to say that whatever precedence we assign among those 5 codes is irrelevant to the others.  That is, as long as the order among these 5 is correct in the table, I am tempted to say it does not matter where in the table they occur. 

*Except* that as of now we're using "Returned" for TWX, which is a code that is also used at other sites, and that probably makes it matter. 

Though it is possible that a fish could generate more than one of these outcomes at tw, I believe the vast majority will have only one of them.  Let's go with this precedence:

A - ignore others - should come before R
W - ignore others - should come before R
M - ignore others - should come before R
R - takes precedence over D and G
D - takes precedence over G
G - lowest precedence

My secondary thoughts on this: (1) don't do this now, but if we changed the outcome for TWX from R to X (which would be new), the tw outcomes would be completely independent of all the others.  (2) I'm a bit disappointed to realize that if a fish *does* get more than one outcome at tw, we have to lose some information.  (e.g., a fish *could* get an "R" and a "W", but under current configuration, we have no way to preserve all the info). Once we get capthist working in the way we're talking about now, I might experiment with some ways to configure it to preserve the info -- I have a hunch it's doable using the sites_config and ppc files in combination, without any further coding required by you.

------

* The codes S, H, T, R, B, U, and N all refer to antennas within juvenile bypass systems jbs at dams.  The precedence represented in your table appears to be appropriate, and I assume that this is what capthist currently does (and has done since The Beginning).  Under most conditions, it is *expected* that a fish will generate multple outcome codes as it passes through a jbs.  Thus, information is lost when the precedence is applied and a single outcome is selected. However, this information is almost never of interest.
